// Absurdle
// This program creats a game similar to the popular NYT game "Wordle", called "Absurdle".
// The player gets to indicate which dictionary they would like the game to be based off of, 
// as well as the length of the word they will be expected to guess. Each incorrect guess recieves
// feedback in the form of colored tiles indicating how closely each letter matches the target
// word. Guessed letters that exactly match the target word are marked green while letters that
// are in the target word but not in the right possition are marked yellow, and letters that are
// not in the taget word are marked gray. The caviat with Absurdle is that it does not actually
// pick a target word at the beginning of the game. Absurdle gives the impression of picking a
// single secret word, but instead what it actually does is consider the entire list of all 
// possible secret words. Each time you guess, Absurdle prunes its internal list as little as 
// possible, attempting to intentionally prolong the game as much as possible.
